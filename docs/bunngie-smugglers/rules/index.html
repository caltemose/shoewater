		<p>This page lists the rules of the Bunngie Smugglers clan.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Donâ€™t be a dick, whether in game chats or discord. Any abuse will reviewed by admins. Severe abuse may lead to an instant removal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be active. If for any reason you are away for a prolonged period message @BlueMoon. Being active doesn&rsquo;t just mean in game, we need people to be vocal on discord also and help others within the clan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To keep things fair for all we review admins and members from time to time. For transparency we look at light level across 3 characters, time played over the last month and discord use. We do this to keep the clan fresh and on top of people being in the clan for Hawthorne!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If like most of us you play and enjoy the game you&rsquo;ll have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Peace out guardians.</p>
