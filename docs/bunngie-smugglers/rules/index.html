		<p>This page lists the rules of the Bunngie Smugglers clan.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t be a dick, whether in game chats or Discord. Any abuse will reviewed by admins. Severe abuse may lead to an instant removal.</li>
<li>Please be active. If for any reason you are away for a prolonged period message <strong>@BlueMoon</strong>. Being active doesn’t just mean in game, we need people to be vocal on Discord also and help others within the clan.</li>
<li>To keep things fair for all we review admins and members from time to time. For transparency we look at light level across 3 characters, time played over the last month and Discord use. We do this to keep the clan fresh and on top of people being in the clan for Hawthorne!</li>
<li>Please make your Discord name the same as your PSN id. If you do not want to, then put your PSN id in parentheses after your Discord name like so: <strong>Superman (superman2020)</strong> If you ignore this people won&rsquo;t know how to invite you to matches and you may miss out on activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>If like most of us you play and enjoy the game you’ll have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Peace out guardians.</p>
