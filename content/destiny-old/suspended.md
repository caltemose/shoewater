After seeing a clanmate get suspended from Gambit a few times I thought I'd write about the technical side to suspension to try to provide some clarification and potentially some relief to players who've felt this pain.<!--more-->

Full disclosure, if you are actively rage-quitting matches and get suspended, that's on you and I have no sympathy.

Standard disclaimer: I'm a web programmer and not a game programmer so take this with a grain of salt. [Read here](/shoewater/disclaimer) if you're curious why I make that distinction.

I've seen this before where the player doesn't actively quit a match but is penalized nonetheless. This could happen thanks to a flakey network connection or other reasons outside the player's control.

This is one of those cases where I'm likely to side with the player more than Bungie although I freely admit without a complete understanding of Bungie's logic for suspension, I can only comment on what I know or make educated guesses about.

When this topic is discussed on a game board or in chat, many players understand that Bungie cannot perfectly determine whether or not a player actively intended to drop a match (and therefore should be penalized/suspended). My purpose here is to shed just a little light on what happens technically.

If a player is in a match, pulls up the HUD and selects "Leave match" then clearly that player is dropping the match intentionally and this should count against the player since that player is degrading the game for the other players. Bungie knows you've actively left the match because selecting the "Leave match" option doesn't happen by accident or glitch. This isn't a grey area other than Bungie not knowing why you quit the match (maybe your smoke alarm is going off and in an ideal world, you wouldn't be penalized).

However, the other reasons a player leaves a match are likely harder to decipher for Bungie. I'll refer to these as passively dropping the match. In some cases the player may intentionally be quitting the match but in most cases, it's likely the player has left the match outside of his/her control. Some examples:

1. network is flakey and player is dropped from match
2. person quits the game application
3. power goes out and with it goes the game console/pc
4. person powers off the console/pc

I'm going to assume Bungie cannot tell the difference between any of these although I may be wrong. If my assumption is correct then the player in these cases should be penalized, but to a much lesser extent than when the player actively leaves the match.

Let's presume that suspension works on a scoring system and when you get to 10 points, you are suspended.

If you actively leave a match, then maybe you are given 3 points against suspension.

If you passively leave a match, through one of the reasons in the list above, then maybe you are given 1 point against suspension.

This way, you are much less likely to get suspended if you keep passively quitting a match but you are still penalized because even though it may not be your fault, you are degrading the game for other players (pretend your the other players - you don't care why a player left your team, you are just annoyed that you are now at a disadvantage).

Another enhancement of this system would be to recognize when a player passively quits and if it happens over and over again, then that player is given more than 1 point toward suspension. This may seem unfair but if you are a player with a consistently flakey network, or with power outtage issues, then you are going to cause other players problems if you continue to play network matches.

There are a lot of ways this system could be enhanced to be fairer and more accurate but to be fruitful, that discussion requires participation of Bungie developers and other people who are deep in the know of console programming and large-scale network gaming.
