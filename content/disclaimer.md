My comments here are meant to help those without programming backgrounds better understand various issues with technology and more specifically, gaming.

I am a web programmer. And I am not traditionally-trained; I did not attend a computer science or engineering school. I learned on my own. 

I make these disclaimers because my comments about gaming code and technical issues are hopefully well-informed but I do not speak from direct experience. I have no understanding of the complexities of building massive online gaming systems and I hold those who do in high regard. That shit seems way too complicated for me to ever wrap my brain entirely around. However, I can understand bits of it because in the end, programming is programming. It is based on logic that very often requires no deep technical knowledge to understand.
