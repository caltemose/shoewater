<!--more-->

1. Donâ€™t be a dick, whether in game chats or discord. Any abuse will reviewed by admins. Severe abuse may lead to an instant removal.

2. Please be active. If for any reason you are away for a prolonged period message @BlueMoon. Being active doesn't just mean in game, we need people to be vocal on discord also and help others within the clan.

3. To keep things fair for all we review admins and members from time to time. For transparency we look at light level across 3 characters, time played over the last month and discord use. We do this to keep the clan fresh and on top of people being in the clan for Hawthorne!

If like most of us you play and enjoy the game you'll have nothing to worry about.

Peace out guardians.
